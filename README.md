## For Maintainers

Follow the following instructions on a new release.

### Update the formula url

Edit the formula and set the new release tag and revision in the url section.

See [example](https://github.com/noobaa/homebrew-noobaa/blob/5ec5108b18a6e8ea1bb58e47b0fc3cae63641e11/Formula/noobaa.rb#L4-L6):

```ruby
  url "https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-operator.git",
      :tag      => "v5.7.0",
      :revision => "054bc35207d5c3cae70838052b76b55149c1c260"
```

### Build bottle locally

```bash
$ brew uninstall noobaa
$ brew install noobaa --build-bottle
$ brew bottle noobaa
==> Determining noobaa/noobaa/noobaa bottle rebuild...
==> Bottling noobaa--5.7.0.big_sur.bottle.1.tar.gz...
==> Detecting if noobaa--5.7.0.big_sur.bottle.1.tar.gz is relocatable...
./noobaa--5.7.0.big_sur.bottle.1.tar.gz
  bottle do
    rebuild 1
    sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, big_sur: "35745610631857420a1dc66f0ba752b5e825611e15c5e54f981f9bb6b7a330db"
  end
```

### Note on MacOS versions

Notice that in the examples I renamed the macos version of the bottle file to `mojave` although I built it on `big_sur` (both the file name and in the sha256 line). 

Not sure if this is really needed or not, but the intention was to make this bottle apply for the oldest macos version we can support since the binary itself is portable anyhow.


### Upload the bottle

Edit the release and upload the bottle tar file to the release assets.

See example release - https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-operator/releases/tag/v5.7.0

### Update the formula bottle

Edit the formula `bottle do` section to the new release download url and the sha256 as provided from brew bottle before.

See [example](https://github.com/noobaa/homebrew-noobaa/blob/193e23780131ab3db2d3eb39ddb971f7e5e6f04a/Formula/noobaa.rb#L9-L13):

```ruby
  bottle do
    root_url "https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-operator/releases/download/v5.7.0"
    sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, mojave: "35745610631857420a1dc66f0ba752b5e825611e15c5e54f981f9bb6b7a330db"
    rebuild 1
  end
```
